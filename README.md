This project demonstrates a fundamental web application: a to-do list. Utilizing the core web technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a user-friendly interface for task management.

HTML provides the foundational structure of the page, defining elements like input fields for entering tasks, buttons for actions (add, delete, mark complete), and the list itself. CSS enhances the visual appeal, applying colors, fonts, and spacing for a clean and organized presentation. It also introduces visual cues like strikethrough or color changes to differentiate between completed and incomplete tasks.

The true power lies in JavaScript. It handles the dynamic aspects, such as:

Event Handling: Responding to user interactions with buttons (e.g., clicking "Add Task").
Data Manipulation: Creating new list items dynamically, adding them to the list, and updating their appearance based on completion status.
Data Persistence: Utilizing browser storage (like localStorage) to save the list, ensuring that tasks are retained even if the page is refreshed or closed.
This project serves as an excellent foundation for learning core web development principles. It demonstrates how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
